    "Appleâ€™s current assets have steadily increased both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, indicating improved liquidity.",
    "Current liabilities have risen moderately but remain well-covered by current assets, as reflected in a stable and slightly improving current ratio around 1.5.",
    "Non-current liabilities have also increased, but total liabilities relative to shareholder equity (debt-to-equity ratio) remain stable, suggesting a balanced use of debt financing.",
    "Operating profit and net income continue to grow modestly, reflecting healthy profitability trends.",
    "Quick ratio estimated matches the current ratio since inventory data is unavailable; this suggests that liquid assets are strong relative to short-term obligations.",
    "Quarter-over-quarter improvements indicate good short-term operational efficiency, while year-over-year growth signals strong long-term financial health and resilience.",
    "No significant red flags in liquidity or leverage; overall financial position appears solid with steady growth in earnings and asset base."
