**Summary paragraph:**  
The 2025 CRM data exhibits dynamic growth in Sales and Accounts, especially in mid-year months, signaling expanding business opportunities. However, Marketing reveals bottlenecks in lead engagement, with many leads remaining uncontacted, thereby restricting the sales funnel's potential.
