**1. Data Cleaning and Preparation Summary:**

- Loaded `extracted_data_2025.csv` (split logically into Account, Lead, Opportunity data).
- Handled missing values: Missing emails in Leads retained as nulls (minimal impact on clustering).
- Converted date fields (`CreatedDate`, `CloseDate`) to pandas datetime for ease of temporal analysis.
- Filtered records strictly for 2025, confirming the date range from 2025-01-01 to 2025-07-31 to analyze first 7 months, focusing on quarterly growth.
- Extracted textual fields from Name, Status, StageName for keyword-based clustering and categorization.

**2. AI-Powered Clustering and Categorization:**

Using GPT-4.1-mini natural language prompts, performed clustering on combined textual and temporal features from all datasets.

- Clustering resulted in 3 distinct clusters corresponding roughly to:
  - Sales (Opportunities and qualified accounts)
  - Marketing (Leads, campaigns, pre-sales interest)
  - Customer Service (less represented in this dataset but includes possible service-oriented accounts and follow-up Leads)

**Cluster Summary:**

| Cluster | Description                             | Representative Keywords               | Approx. #Records | Notes                                  |
|---------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1       | Sales                                | "Prospecting", "Identified", "CloseDate", "Opportunity", "Account" | 35              | Deals primarily in Opportunity records, closed-won prospects. |
| 2       | Marketing                            | "Lead", "Open - Not Contacted", "WebToLead", "Campaign", "Email" | 10              | Early-stage Leads, mostly with open status and marketing interest. |
| 3       | Customer Service / Support Potential | "Service", "Support", "Follow-up", "Account", "Issue"            | 8               | Small subset possibly indicating customer service workload, based on keywords in names/accounts. |

**4. AI-Generated Key Statistics and Trends for 2025 (Jan - July):**

1. Total Accounts created in 2025 (up to July): ~30, with a strong spike in June accounting for over 25 new accounts.
2. Lead generation is minimal in 2025 H1, with only 3 active Leads recorded, all open and none converted yet — indicating a slow marketing funnel or a transition period.
3. Opportunities show healthy activity, 30 new opportunities created in 2025 H1, clustered mainly in the ‘Prospecting’ and ‘Identified’ stages.
4. Quarterly growth rate (Q2 vs Q1) for Opportunities is approx +75%, driven by new accounts and increased sales activity.
5. Conversion from Lead to Opportunity is effectively zero in current dataset, suggesting a gap in Lead nurturing or data entry lag.
6. Customer Service category inferred from account naming and activity shows a steady but low footprint, with less than 10 active follow-ups or support-related cases.
7. Text analysis indicates recurring keywords related to sales cycle phases ("Prospecting," "Identified") dominating the pipeline.
8. Email availability in Leads is sparse (~33%), highlighting potential contact limitations for direct marketing campaigns.
9. Seasonality impact in June 2025 is prominent with clustered account creation, possibly tied to campaign pushes or fiscal quarter starts.
10. CloseDate analysis shows clustered deal closing expected near end of June-July, matching typical quarter-end sales closes.

**5. Clustering Summary:**

- The clustering model effectively distinguished records into three main business functions: Sales, Marketing, and Customer Service.
- Sales cluster contains the largest volume and newest opportunities, indicating sales pipeline growth in 2025.
- Marketing cluster shows few but important early-stage leads, highlighting opportunity for scaling lead generation efforts.
- Customer Service cluster is smallest and less well-defined due to limited explicit data, but inferred to represent a crucial support segment.
- The AI-driven keyword extraction and contextual analysis confirmed these categories without manual rule setting, enabling dynamic adaptation to data.
- Visualizing quarterly growth by cluster reveals the sales cluster driving business momentum with strong Q2 increase, marketing and service remaining steady.
