### Step 1: Data Loading and Cleaning

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load CSV
df = pd.read_csv('outputs/salesforce_connector/extracted_data_2025.csv')

# Preview data shape and columns
print("Data Shape:", df.shape)
print("Columns:", df.columns)

# Handle missing values: drop rows with critical missing data or fill where appropriate
df_clean = df.copy()
# Example: fill missing 'Name' with placeholder
df_clean['Name'].fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)

# Convert date columns to datetime
date_cols = [col for col in df.columns if 'Date' in col or 'Created' in col]
for col in date_cols:
    df_clean[col] = pd.to_datetime(df_clean[col], errors='coerce')

# Drop rows where CreatedDate is NaT or missing as they are critical for trend analysis
df_clean.dropna(subset=['CreatedDate'], inplace=True)
```

### Step 2: Data Overview by Object Type (Accounts, Leads, Opportunities, Users)

Based on given context, data includes multiple Salesforce objects joined or concatenated. We separate for clarity:

- Accounts: Many rows, 3 columns (Id, Name, CreatedDate)
- Leads: Many rows, 3 columns (Id, Name, CreatedDate)
- Opportunities: Many rows, 4 columns (Id, Name, StageName, CreatedDate)
- Users: Many rows, 4 columns (Id, Name, Email, CreatedDate)

### Step 3: Categorization into Sales, Marketing, and Customer Service

Using AI-powered keyword extraction and contextual understanding, categories are defined as:  

- **Sales**: Opportunities (deals, closed won, stages), Accounts (customer companies)
- **Marketing**: Leads (potential customers, campaigns)
- **Customer Service**: User support related records (if evident), other service-related opportunities, or keywords related to support, service

Extract keywords from Name and StageName fields using GPT-4.1-mini-2025-04-14 AI natural language prompting.

### Step 4: Clustering

Using AI to cluster similar records by text fields and dates to reveal natural groupings, e.g., by opportunity types, lead types, or accounts by industry keywords.

### Step 5: Trend Analysis for 2025 by Quarter

Aggregate counts per quarter of 2025 for each category, track growth, drop, or stable patterns.
