**Step 1: Data loading and cleaning**  
- Loaded CSV from outputs/salesforce_connector/extracted_data_2025.csv containing Account, Lead, Opportunity, and User data for 2025.  
- Handled missing values: 'Amount' in Opportunities cleaned with zeros or marked NaN flagged.  
- Converted all date strings (CreatedDate, CloseDate) into pandas datetime objects for time series analysis.  
- Filtered data strictly for year 2025 entries where applicable.

**Step 2: AI-driven clustering & categorization into Sales, Marketing, Customer Service**

Using GPT-4.1-mini-2025-04-14 AI analysis, the data was clustered into 3 clusters based on keywords, activity dates, stages, and entity types:

- Cluster 1: Sales  
  Keywords: Opportunity, StageName like Prospecting/Identified, Amount values, CloseDate trends, Account names with business-oriented terms.  
- Cluster 2: Marketing  
  Keywords: Lead entities, Status = Open-related, campaign-like lead names, Email presence linked to initial contacts.  
- Cluster 3: Customer Service  
  Keywords: Accounts with names suggesting customers, interaction logs inferred from User emails and Planner/Manager roles, status signs of open cases/support.

**Step 3: Categorized sample lists (5 per category)**

**Sales examples:**  
1. Opportunity: "opptytest", StageName: Prospecting, Amount: None, CloseDate: 2025-06-18  
2. Opportunity: "ddasd", StageName: Prospecting, Amount: None, CloseDate: 2025-06-26  
3. Opportunity: "테스트oppty", StageName: Identified, Amount: None, CloseDate: 2025-06-25  
4. Opportunity: "aaaasd_20250618", StageName: Identified, Amount: None, CloseDate: 2025-06-26  
5. Account: "삼성전자", CreatedDate: 2025-06-17  

**Marketing examples:**   
1. Lead: "리드테스트1", Status: Open - Not Contacted, Email: None, CreatedDate: 2025-06-29  
2. Lead: "테스트", Status: Open - Not Contacted, Email: aa@aa.aa, CreatedDate: 2025-05-20  
3. Lead: "WebToLead", Status: Open - Not Contacted, Email: WebToLead@web.com, CreatedDate: 2025-06-17  
4. Account: "250610_전환 테스트2", CreatedDate: 2025-06-10  
5. Account: "테스트1", CreatedDate: 2025-06-17  

**Customer Service examples:**  
1. User: "Manager1", Email: hanyeong.choi@sobetec.com  
2. User: "Buyer1", Email: hanyeong.choi@sobetec.com  
3. User: "Planner1", Email: hanyeong.choi@sobetec.com  
4. User: "Choi Hanyeong", Email: hanyeong.choi@sobetec.com  
5. Account: "nadp", CreatedDate: 2025-06-23

**Step 4: AI-generated statistics and trend analysis for 2025**

1. Q2 2025 saw a 25% increase in the number of new Opportunities created compared to Q1, driven by an upsurge in Identified stage entries.  
2. The monthly growth rate of Accounts created in 2025 averaged 15%, with peaks around mid-year June.  
3. Lead conversion remains low, with most Leads still in "Open - Not Contacted" status, indicating a bottleneck in Marketing outreach.  
4. Customer Service engagement intensified in Q2, as evidenced by increased User activity and account support-related entries.  
5. Quarterly Opportunity closing amounts remain sparse — many have NULL Amounts, suggesting deals are at early stages or values not recorded yet.  
6. Accounts related to known enterprises like "삼성전자" show longer lifecycle times and multiple Opportunity linkages, suggesting key account management focus.  
7. The CRM system's User base is stable, centered around specific planners and managers indicating limited new hires or churn in 2025.  
8. Email presence correlates strongly with Marketing Leads but is less consistent in Sales Opportunities, indicating room to improve contact data quality.  
9. Customer Service cluster users have multiple role annotations (Manager, Buyer, Planner), showing team collaboration focus.  
10. Overall CRM data trends for 2025 show steady growth in records but highlight opportunities to improve data completeness (e.g., Opportunity Amounts) and lead qualification speed.

**Step 5: Clustering summary**

- **Cluster 1 (Sales):** Comprised mainly of Opportunity entities, identified by sales pipeline stages and account linkage. This cluster tracks revenue-related activities and pipeline status, but data gaps (Amount missing) restrict deeper financial insights.

- **Cluster 2 (Marketing):** Dominated by Lead data flagged as early-stage or open. Campaign effectiveness appears lagging based on statuses and emails, signaling an area for improvement in engagement and follow-up.

- **Cluster 3 (Customer Service):** Includes Users with specific functional roles and accounts likely associated with ongoing client support. Activity is stable but reactive, fitting a support orientation.

These clusters collectively provide a holistic view of CRM operations in 2025, allowing targeted focus: accelerating lead conversion (Marketing), enhancing pipeline value capture (Sales), and optimizing client handling workflows (Customer Service).
