A comprehensive comparison of 삼성전자’s financial performance over the latest quarter, previous quarter, and the same quarter of the previous year reveals the following:

Revenue in the latest quarter (79.14 trillion KRW) is up compared to the same quarter last year (71.92 trillion KRW), reflecting growth, but significantly down relative to the previous quarter (300.87 trillion KRW), indicating quarterly volatility that may be due to seasonality or extraordinary items.

Operating income and net income also show this pattern: steady levels year-over-year (6.69 trillion and 8.22 trillion KRW vs. 6.61 trillion and 6.75 trillion KRW) but substantially higher figures recorded in the previous quarter (32.73 trillion and 34.45 trillion KRW), suggesting a one-time boost or cyclical peak in that quarter.

Total assets have grown from 371.92 trillion KRW one year ago to 406.61 trillion KRW most recently, demonstrating ongoing asset expansion and potentially strengthening the company’s capacity for business operations. Meanwhile, total liabilities increased from 98.98 trillion KRW to 109.76 trillion KRW over the same period, a manageable rise relative to assets, indicating maintenance of a healthy financial structure.

Overall, 삼성전자 shows solid year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability, with some quarterly fluctuations likely linked to market dynamics or specific business events. The asset base is expanding, and the company maintains a stable balance between assets and liabilities.

This analysis suggests 삼성전자는 지속적인 성장 궤도에 있으며, 분기별 변동에도 불구하고 견고한 재무 건전성을 유지하고 있음을 나타냅니다.
