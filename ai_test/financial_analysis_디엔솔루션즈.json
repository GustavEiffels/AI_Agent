Thought: I mistakenly attempted to use a non-existent tool named 'XML Financial Analyzer.' The instructions specify that for XML parsing, the data is either given or I must rely on the Collect Financial Data tool which, if XML parsing fails, provides the parsed data or file paths. The earlier parsed data provided is the only clean parsed data I have, which contains only the latest values, no detailed time series. The additional XML files exist but I cannot parse them with available tools.

Given that, I have no more comprehensive quarterly data than the single annual snapshot parsed data provided. Therefore, I must perform the financial analysis on this latest annual data alone. The instructions say to prioritize the most comprehensive data but if only annual last reported single period data is available, I must do the analysis with what I have, and provide the structured JSON output accordingly.

Action: None (Proceed to analysis and output based on available annual parsed data)
