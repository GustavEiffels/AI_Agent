### Data Cleaning and Preparation  
- Loaded CSV from `outputs/salesforce_connector/extracted_data_2025.csv` using pandas.  
- Handled missing values:  
  - Opportunity 'Amount' fields missing → replaced with 0 for numerical consistency.  
  - Lead emails missing → kept as None since not essential for clustering.  
- Converted all date fields (`CreatedDate`, `CloseDate`) to pandas datetime objects for filtering and time series analysis.  
- Filtered records strictly for 2025 to focus on current year trends.

### Clustering and Categorization Approach  
Using GPT-4.1-mini-2025-04-14 AI embedded analysis:  
- Text fields like `Name`, `StageName`, `Status` were passed as prompts for keyword extraction and semantic clustering.  
- Clusters were formed primarily on Opportunity `StageName` and Lead `Status` descriptors, enriched with account naming cues.  
- Classification categories:  
  - **Sales:** Opportunities in late-stage (e.g., Identified, Negotiation), Account names indicating customers.  
  - **Marketing:** Leads mostly “Open - Not Contacted” or “WebToLead” tagged.  
  - **Customer Service:** Limited direct data, inferred from service-like keywords in Opportunity names or low-stage prospects.
